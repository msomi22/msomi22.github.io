	                    <h2>My believes and my own quotes</h2>

	                    <p> To start with, i believe in the existence of a supernatural being , i won't call Him God, but feel free to call him so. It is also very clear to me that the supreme being ( Let’s call Him God for the purpose of this article) , doesn’t demand me to whatsoever interact with Him in any way. When He created us, he made us like him, simplistically speaking, in the context of any religion , I am a God, and you too is.
	                    </p>

                        <p>
						I am God in that, i can create anything i want via my mind, i can see the future, i know when i will die etc.
					    </p>

                        <p>
						In conclusion, it’s good to say this, my mission in this life, is to :
						<ol type="A">
							<li>Seek knowledge</li>
							<li>Seek better understanding</li>
							<li>Seek my own happiness and</li>
							<li>Ensure that my fellow Gods (Human beings) can believe in  A, B, C and D.</li>
					    </ol>
					   </p>

                         <p>
						Everyone should be happy , anything, anyone who tries to explain to you that, whatever you think and believe can bring happiness to you, is bad or evil. He/she is very evil. 
						  </p>

	                    		<li>Some people are so ignorant, you might think ignorance is the only choice available to them
	                    		</li>

	                    		<li>Ignorance is not knowing nothing, but the inability to demonstrate and  verify how what one know is useful to mankind
	                    		</li>

	                    		<li>The origin of everything is mind.Mind is the alpha and omega is undefined </li>

	                    		<li>Creating from mind is not creating from nothing, anything visible is first create in mind, not from nothing but from energy 
	                    		</li>

	                    		<li>Whoever doesn't have a general goal in life, can not have any other goal </li>

	                    		<li>Creating a new awareness is as important as what the new awareness can result to in the end </li>

	                    		<li>Believing only in oneself doesn't invalidate existence of a supreme being </li>

	                    		<li>If one must believe in anything other than him/herself (his/her mind), is it not more reasonable to demonstrate how and why it seem to work for them that way? </li>

	                    		<li>If there is something like a believe, is it not more reasonable to believe in yourself? Only an idiot can believe in visible object and invisible things other than him/herself </li>

	                    		<li>I am a thinker and all i seek is knowledge or anything i can understand and demonstrate </li>

	                    		<li>It's important to believe in what works for u, but it's more important to teach and demonstrate to others how it works, and how they can make it work for them, so that we can better our living. </li>

	                    		<li>U don't become an idiot because u know, or believe in something. You become one by being not able to demonstrate how what u know/believe in, works, or helps you achieve something, and by acquiring knowledge or believing in what you can't understand or demonstrate </li>

	                    		<li>B4 you teach, you should first evaluate with your student, whether it's you who should be the teacher, it's the student or none of you </li>

	                    		<li>If you feel like u don't understand it well , don't waste time explaining it to me. Just ask that we discuss it together for better understanding </li>

	                    		<li>Being an idiot is believing that u can only do, and/or understanding something, not by your own effort, or help of somebody who understand it better, but by the help of an imaginary thing </li>

	                    		<li>We were lied to, and made to fear living, and fear death. Which renders us useless and just as good as slaves.
                                </li>

	                    		<li>They have lied to us that we should not seek joy, happiness, pleasure, feel good ,etc here on earth. That if we do, we will lack it in 'the next life', that if we live poorly , with less happiness etc , here on earth, we will live happily elsewhere 'heaven' , yet , they live happily themselves.This must be one of the most foolish lies </li>

	                    		<li>Anything that can give u joy, happiness, pleasure and feel good in general, is purely all in need. Anything that prevent you from achieving this, is purely what you don't need at all </li>
